<H2>Introduction</H2></A>
<P>Tree structures support various basic dynamic set operations including 
<I>Search</I>, <I>Predecessor</I>, <I>Successor</I>, <I>Minimum</I>, 
<I>Maximum</I>, <I>Insert</I>, and <I>Delete</I> in time proportional to the 
height of the tree. Ideally, a tree will be balanced and the height will be 
<I>log n</I> where <I>n</I> is the number of nodes in the tree. To ensure that 
the height of the tree is as small as possible and therefore provide the best 
running time, a balanced tree structure like a red-black tree, AVL tree, or 
b-tree must be used.</P>
<P>When working with large sets of data, it is often not possible or desirable 
to maintain the entire structure in primary storage (RAM). Instead, a relatively 
small portion of the data structure is maintained in primary storage, and 
additional data is read from secondary storage as needed. Unfortunately, a 
magnetic disk, the most common form of secondary storage, is significantly 
slower than random access memory (RAM). In fact, the system often spends more 
time retrieving data than actually processing data.</P>
<P>B-trees are balanced trees that are optimized for situations when part or all 
of the tree must be maintained in secondary storage such as a magnetic disk. 
Since disk accesses are expensive (time consuming) operations, a b-tree tries to 
minimize the number of disk accesses. For example, a b-tree with a height of 2 
and a branching factor of 1001 can store over one billion keys but requires at 
most two disk accesses to search for any node (Cormen 384).</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<A name=structure>
<H2>The Structure of B-Trees</H2></A>
<P>Unlike a binary-tree, each node of a b-tree may have a variable number of 
keys and children. The keys are stored in non-decreasing order. Each key has an 
associated child that is the root of a subtree containing all nodes with keys 
less than or equal to the key but greater than the preceeding key. A node also 
has an additional rightmost child that is the root for a subtree containing all 
keys greater than any keys in the node.</P>
<P>A b-tree has a minumum number of allowable children for each node known as 
the <I>minimization factor</I>. If <I>t</I> is this <I>minimization factor</I>, 
every node must have at least <I>t - 1</I> keys. Under certain circumstances, 
the root node is allowed to violate this property by having fewer than <I>t - 
1</I> keys. Every node may have at most <I>2t - 1</I> keys or, equivalently, 
<I>2t</I> children.</P>
<P>Since each node tends to have a large branching factor (a large number of 
children), it is typically neccessary to traverse relatively few nodes before 
locating the desired key. If access to each node requires a disk access, then a 
b-tree will minimize the number of disk accesses required. The minimzation 
factor is usually chosen so that the total size of each node corresponds to a 
multiple of the block size of the underlying storage device. This choice 
simplifies and optimizes disk access. Consequently, a b-tree is an ideal data 
structure for situations where all data cannot reside in primary storage and 
accesses to secondary storage are comparatively expensive (or time 
consuming).</P>
<H3>Height of B-Trees</H3>
<P>For <I>n</I> greater than or equal to one, the height of an <I>n</I>-key 
b-tree T of height <I>h</I> with a minimum degree <I>t</I> greater than or equal 
to 2, <BR>
<CENTER><IMG src="B-Trees_arquivos/height.png"></CENTER><BR>For a proof of the 
above inequality, refer to Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest pages 383-384.
<P></P>
<P>The worst case height is <I>O(log n)</I>. Since the "branchiness" of a b-tree 
can be large compared to many other balanced tree structures, the base of the 
logarithm tends to be large; therefore, the number of nodes visited during a 
search tends to be smaller than required by other tree structures. Although this 
does not affect the asymptotic worst case height, b-trees tend to have smaller 
heights than other trees with the same asymptotic height.</P>
<HR>
<A name=operations>
<H2>Operations on B-Trees</H2></A>
<P>The algorithms for the <I>search</I>, <I>create</I>, and <I>insert</I> 
operations are shown below. Note that these algorithms are single pass; in other 
words, they do not traverse back up the tree. Since b-trees strive to minimize 
disk accesses and the nodes are usually stored on disk, this single-pass 
approach will reduce the number of node visits and thus the number of disk 
accesses. Simpler double-pass approaches that move back up the tree to fix 
violations are possible.</P>
<P>Since all nodes are assumed to be stored in secondary storage (disk) rather 
than primary storage (memory), all references to a given node be be preceeded by 
a read operation denoted by <I>Disk-Read</I>. Similarly, once a node is modified 
and it is no longer needed, it must be written out to secondary storage with a 
write operation denoted by <I>Disk-Write</I>. The algorithms below assume that 
all nodes referenced in parameters have already had a corresponding 
<I>Disk-Read</I> operation. New nodes are created and assigned storage with the 
<I>Allocate-Node</I> call. The implementation details of the <I>Disk-Read</I>, 
<I>Disk-Write</I>, and <I>Allocate-Node</I> functions are operating system and 
implementation dependent.</P><BR>

<P></P>
<P>The search operation on a b-tree is analogous to a search on a binary tree. 
Instead of choosing between a left and a right child as in a binary tree, a 
b-tree search must make an n-way choice. The correct child is chosen by 
performing a linear search of the values in the node. After finding the value 
greater than or equal to the desired value, the child pointer to the immediate 
left of that value is followed. If all values are less than the desired value, 
the rightmost child pointer is followed. Of course, the search can be terminated 
as soon as the desired node is found. Since the running time of the search 
operation depends upon the height of the tree, <I>B-Tree-Search</I> is 
<I>O(log<SUB>t</SUB> n)</I>.</P>

<P>The <I>B-Tree-Create</I> operation creates an empty b-tree by allocating a

<P>If is node becomes "too full," it is necessary to perform a split operation. 
The split operation moves the median key of node <I>x</I> into its parent 
<I>y</I> where <I>x</I> is the <I>i<SUP>th</SUP></I> child of <I>y</I>. A new 
node, <I>z</I>, is allocated, and all keys in <I>x</I> right of the median key 
are moved to <I>z</I>. The keys left of the median key remain in the original 
node <I>x</I>. The new node, <I>z</I>, becomes the child immediately to the 
right of the median key that was moved to the parent <I>y</I>, and the original 
node, <I>x</I>, becomes the child immediately to the left of the median key that 
was moved into the parent <I>y</I>.</P>
<P>The split operation transforms a full node with <I>2t - 1</I> keys into two 
nodes with <I>t - 1</I> keys each. Note that one key is moved into the parent 
node. The <I>B-Tree-Split-Child</I> algorithm will run in time <I>O(t)</I> where 
<I>t</I> is constant.</P>

<P></P>
<P>To perform an insertion on a b-tree, the appropriate node for the key must be 
located using an algorithm similiar to <I>B-Tree-Search</I>. Next, the key must 
be inserted into the node. If the node is not full prior to the insertion, no 
special action is required; however, if the node is full, the node must be split 
to make room for the new key. Since splitting the node results in moving one key 
to the parent node, the parent node must not be full or another split operation 
is required. This process may repeat all the way up to the root and may require 
splitting the root node. This approach requires two passes. The first pass 
locates the node where the key should be inserted; the second pass performs any 
required splits on the ancestor nodes.</P>
<P>Since each access to a node may correspond to a costly disk access, it is 
desirable to avoid the second pass by ensuring that the parent node is never 
full. To accomplish this, the presented algorithm splits any full nodes 
encountered while descending the tree. Although this approach may result in 
unecessary split operations, it guarantees that the parent never needs to be 
split and eliminates the need for a second pass up the tree. Since a split runs 
in linear time, it has little effect on the <I>O(t log<SUB>t</SUB> n)</I> 
running time of <I>B-Tree-Insert</I>.</P>
<P>Splitting the root node is handled as a special case since a new root must be 
created to contain the median key of the old root. Observe that a b-tree will 
grow from the top.</P>
<H3>B-Tree-Delete</H3>
<P>Deletion of a key from a b-tree is possible; however, special care must be 
taken to ensure that the properties of a b-tree are maintained. Several cases 
must be considered. If the deletion reduces the number of keys in a node below 
the minimum degree of the tree, this violation must be corrected by combining 
several nodes and possibly reducing the height of the tree. If the key has 
children, the children must be rearranged. For a detailed discussion of deleting 
from a b-tree, refer to Section 19.3, pages 395-397, of Cormen, Leiserson, and 
Rivest or to another reference listed below.</P>

<H3>Databases</H3>
<P>A <A href="http://www.whatis.com/database.htm">database</A> is a collection 
of data organized in a fashion that facilitates updating, retrieving, and 
managing the data. The data can consist of anything, including, but not limited 
to names, addresses, pictures, and numbers. Databases are commonplace and are 
used everyday. For example, an airline reservation system might maintain a 
database of available flights, customers, and tickets issued. A teacher might 
maintain a database of student names and grades.</P>
<P>Because computers excel at quickly and accurately manipulating, storing, and 
retrieving data, databases are often maintained electronically using a 
<I>database management system</I>. Database management systems are essential 
components of many everyday business operations. Database products like <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql"><I>Microsoft SQL Server</I></A>, <A 
href="http://www.sybase.com/products/databaseservers"><I>Sybase Adaptive 
Server</I></A>, <A href="http://www.ibm.com/db2"><I>IBM DB2</I></A>, and <A 
href="http://www.oracle.com/database"><I>Oracle</I></A> serve as a foundation 
for accounting systems, inventory systems, medical recordkeeping sytems, airline 
reservation systems, and countless other important aspects of modern 
businesses.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon for a database to contain millions of records requiring 
many gigabytes of storage. For examples, TELSTRA, an Australian 
telecommunications company, maintains a customer billing database with 51 
billion rows (yes, billion) and 4.2 terabytes of data. In order for a database 
to be useful and usable, it must support the desired operations, such as 
retrieval and storage, quickly. Because databases cannot typically be maintained 
entirely in memory, b-trees are often used to index the data and to provide fast 
access. For example, searching an unindexed and unsorted database containing 
<I>n</I> key values will have a worst case running time of <I>O(n)</I>; if the 
same data is indexed with a b-tree, the same search operation will run in 
<I>O(log n)</I>. To perform a search for a single key on a set of one million 
keys (1,000,000), a linear search will require at most 1,000,000 comparisons. If 
the same data is indexed with a b-tree of minimum degree 10, 114 comparisons 
will be required in the worst case. Clearly, indexing large amounts of data can 
significantly improve search performance. Although other balanced tree 
structures can be used, a b-tree also optimizes costly disk accesses that are of 
concern when dealing with large data sets.</P>
<H3>Concurrent Access to B-Trees</H3>
<P>Databases typically run in multiuser environments where many users can 
concurrently perform operations on the database. Unfortunately, this common 
scenario introduces complications. For example, imagine a database storing bank 
account balances. Now assume that someone attempts to withdraw $40 from an 
account containing $60. First, the current balance is checked to ensure 
sufficent funds. After funds are disbursed, the balance of the account is 
reduced. This approach works flawlessly until concurrent transactions are 
considered. Suppose that another person simultaneously attempts to withdraw $30 
from the same account. At the same time the account balance is checked by the 
first person, the account balance is also retrieved for the second person. Since 
neither person is requesting more funds than are currently available, both 
requests are satisfied for a total of $70. After the first person's transaction, 
$20 should remain ($60 - $40), so the new balance is recorded as $20. Next, the 
account balance after the second person's transaction, $30 ($60 - $30), is 
recorded overwriting the $20 balance. Unfortunately, $70 have been disbursed, 
but the account balance has only been decreased by $30. Clearly, this behavior 
is undesirable, and special precautions must be taken.</P>
<P>A b-tree suffers from similar problems in a multiuser environment. If two or 
more processes are manipulating the same tree, it is possible for the tree to 
become corrupt and result in data loss or errors.</P>
<P>The simplest solution is to serialize access to the data structure. In other 
words, if another process is using the tree, all other processes must wait. 
Although this is feasible in many cases, it can place an unecessary and costly 
limit on performance because many operations actually can be performed 
concurrently without risk. <I>Locking</I>, introduced by Gray and refined by 
many others, provides a mechanism for controlling concurrent operations on data 
structures in order to prevent undesirable side effects and to ensure 
consistency. For a detailed discussion of this and other concurrency control 
mechanisms, please refer to the references below.</P>
