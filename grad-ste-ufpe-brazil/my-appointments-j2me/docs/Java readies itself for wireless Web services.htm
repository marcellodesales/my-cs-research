<P><IMG height=29 alt=C

align=left>onvenience is the major motivation behind our adoption of wireless 
technology. The ability to access information anytime from anywhere drastically 
increases our productivity as well as our quality of life by allowing us to work 
from home, car, school, or vacation resorts, and manage time more flexibly. 
Besides the unprecedented convenience, a wireless Internet also improves the 
quality of the information services. By taking advantage of wireless devices' 
pervasive nature, you can dynamically customize information services for each 
user based on her location, mood, or other real-time data.
<P>The wireless Internet's dynamic nature requires a new breed of dynamic 
services, which likely involves many service providers. Even simple mobile 
commerce tasks require much expertise. For example, a straightforward stock 
trade application necessitates services such as user authentication and 
authorization, customer relationship management, stock quotes and tracking, 
trade executing, and fund transfer. Those services are built upon more basic 
services, such as Internet connectivity, security, and transactional reliability 
monitors. The IT industry's history has shown that a single vendor cannot offer 
the best expertise or services in all fields. The best economic model features 
small vendors providing modularized service components, each serving its core 
competency. Those modularized reusable software components are called <EM>Web 
services</EM>. To minimize bandwidth and CPU usage, wireless users can 
selectively use only the core services they need. Applications that utilize a 
wireless front end for pervasive human interfaces and Web services on the back 
end to leverage the Internet's vast information resources are called 
<EM>wireless Web services</EM> applications.
<P>Web services from different vendors must interoperate from machine to machine 
to provide transparent services to customers. Distributed computing services 
have long been able to work with each other through remote procedure calls (RPC) 
and remote object frameworks. However, building such an interoperable network on 
an Internet scale requires industry-wide standardization of communication 
protocols. We have XML-based protocols to standardize Web services' dynamic 
discovery processes (UDDI, or Universal Description, Discovery, and 
Integration); service interfaces (WSDL, or Web Services Description Language); 
and asynchronous and synchronous messaging (SOAP, or Simple Object Access 
Protocol, and XML-RPC). On top of those communication protocols, other protocols 
provide more enhanced functionalities, such as the XML Encryption and XML 
Digital Signature protocols for improving security. For instance, you can embed 
an XML digital signature in a SOAP message to guarantee that message's 
integrity. 
<P>Throughout this article, we explain wireless Web services' network 
architectures, how Java fits into the wireless Web services picture, evolving 
technologies, and future trends. Since much literature already discusses 
server-side Java platforms and Java-based Web services, we focus only on Java's 
role in <EM>wireless</EM> application development. 
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Wireless Web services architectures 
</STRONG></FONT><BR>A wireless Web service can feature one of the following 
architectures: wireless portal network, wireless extended Internet, or wireless 
ad hoc network. 
<P><STRONG>Wireless portal network </STRONG><BR>In a wireless portal network, 
the wireless information devices connect to the Internet backend services 
through portal entry points. The portal creates a "walled garden" and controls 
access to Internet contents. Wireless portal networks support widely deployed 
thin-client wireless technology, such as WAP (Wireless Application Protocol). In 
general, a WAP-based Web services portal works like this: The wireless device 
sends an information request embedded in a WML (Wireless Markup Language) form. 
The portal receives the message, checks the user's privilege, and then 
translates the request to a SOAP message or an XML-RPC call to an appropriate 
partner Web service. The Web service replies, and the portal translates the 
response back to a WML document. The portal sends the WML document back to the 
wireless device for display. In this way, the portal works as a proxy for 
wireless users. The portal operator provides user authorization and management 
services. Many partner vendors can provide real application Web services under 
the ASP (application service provider) model.
<P>The advantages of thin client-based portal networks include:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The technology is mature, widely deployed, and well supported. If you 
  require immediate wireless capabilities, you should investigate this option.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Thin clients require little computing power and therefore can run on 
  small, light devices.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Only server-side computers can handle many computationally intensive 
  application functionalities—such as voice recognition engines, as we will 
  discuss later. </LI></UL>
<P>However, wireless portal network combined with thin clients might not fit 
best for dynamic wireless Web services for the following reasons:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>From the business viewpoint, the portal architecture requires a central 
  entity to control all user data. Backend service providers must rely on the 
  portal architecture to access users. The portal provider decides what services 
  can access its walled garden and demands a profit share from partners. That 
  could cause serious business concerns if an untrustworthy, insecure, or 
  abusive monopoly controlled the portal.
  <P></P>
  <LI>The portal architecture has a central failure point, which exposes the 
  whole network to attacks.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Thin clients offer limited user interfaces. They are not pervasive.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Thin clients do not remember complex application state information; thus, 
  the user must navigate through multiple pages to complete complex tasks, such 
  as transactions. Not only is that inconvenient to the user, but it is also 
  slow and uses precious wireless bandwidth. Moreover, it renders thin clients 
  vulnerable to network interruptions.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Thin clients only support limited and predefined security protocols, such 
  as HTTPS secure connections. We cannot have application-specific flexible 
  security policies. In case of a WAP portal, a misconfigured gateway can easily 
  cause security gaps.</LI></UL>
<P>New advances in wireless devices technology allow small devices to run more 
sophisticated client software, or <EM>fat clients</EM>. A network structure 
designed for fat clients can eliminate many problems of the thin-client portal 
network solution. 
<P><STRONG>Wireless extended Internet </STRONG><BR>Wireless extended Internet is 
the wired Internet's expansion to wireless devices. Today's handheld devices 
have more computing power than many desktop PCs did 10 years ago. Wireless 
information devices can have their own IP addresses (through Internet Protocol 
6) and full network functionalities. Those devices usually run smart, fat 
clients that interact with multiple backend services simultaneously and 
store/process application data on the device. 
<P>Smart devices support sophisticated user interfaces, offline processing, and 
automatic transactions. They can also implement flexible, application-specific 
security policies. Like the Internet itself, the wireless extended Internet 
architecture is decentralized (without a controlling business entity) and 
eliminates any single point of failure. However, as you will see later, 
centralized Web services hubs are still required to support advanced security 
schemes (such as single sign-on authentication) and user interfaces (such as 
VoiceXML engines). Unlike the portal architecture, the hubs themselves can be 
decentralized. Different vendors can provide similar hub services that can 
interoperate with each other. Figure 1 shows a topography diagram for such 
networks.

<P>The extended wireless Internet architectures blended with decentralized hub 
Web services will provide the foundation for future wireless Web services 
applications, an approach we focus on throughout this article. Since most of the 
supporting technologies are just emerging, many challenges prevail. In later 
sections, we will discuss those challenges and suggest solutions. 
<P><STRONG>Wireless ad hoc network </STRONG><BR>The wireless ad hoc networks 
allow wireless devices to become servers to peers. Wireless peers can provide 
content, network traffic routing, and many other services. The ad hoc network 
truly leverages wireless networks' dynamic nature. However, because wireless 
peer-to-peer technology is still embryonic, its many performance and security 
issues must be solved before it can be widely used. 
<P>We do not discuss wireless ad hoc networks in detail in this article. Readers 
interested in Java-based peer-to-peer frameworks should check out <A

server computers and handheld devices. <!-- break -->
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>What is Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition? 
</STRONG></FONT><BR>In addition to choosing the most appropriate wireless Web 
services architecture, we must also choose the most powerful and flexible 
development platform. In this section, we examine the Java development platform 
for wireless applications—Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME).
<P>Though a lightweight version of Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE), 
J2ME is not exactly a subset of J2SE. J2ME keeps some of the J2SE core library 
APIs, but substitutes others with lightweight components through the 
<CODE>javax.microedition</CODE> package. Sun, understanding the large variety of 
wireless devices and realizing that one size does not fit all, divided the J2ME 
platform into several layers and groups.
<P>At the bottom of the J2ME hierarchy are two <EM>configurations</EM> that 
provide JVMs and core language libraries. Connected Limited Device Configuration 
(CLDC) is for the smallest wireless devices with 160 KB or more memory and slow 
16/32-bit processors. CLDC has limited math, string, and I/O (input/output) 
functionalities and lacks features such as JNI (Java Native Interface), custom 
class loaders, and reflection. As a result, CLDC virtual machines cannot support 
most J2SE standard libraries.
<P>Connected Device Configuration (CDC) is for more capable wireless devices 
with at least 2 MB of memory and 32-bit processors. CDC supports a fully 
featured Java 2 VM and therefore can take advantage of most J2SE libraries. 
<P>Configurations provide the most basic and generic language functionalities. 
On top of each configuration are multiple <EM>profiles</EM> targeted at specific 
devices. The profiles provide more advanced APIs such as a graphical user 
interface (GUI), persistent storage, security, and network connectivity. Mobile 
Information Device Profile (MIDP) and PDA Profile, two profiles based on CLDC, 
target cell phones and PDA devices, respectively. Based in CDC, the Foundation 
Profile provides more utility, network, and security functions for embedded 
devices, but no GUIs. The Personal Profile sits on top of CDC and the Foundation 
Profile. It provides J2SE Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT)-compatible GUI APIs 
for high-end PDAs and wireless Internet appliances. Figure 2 illustrates the 
J2ME platform architecture.

<P>Though a lighter version of Java, J2ME still retains the language's 
underlying benefits.
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>The Java advantage </STRONG></FONT><BR>We all know the 
benefits of the Java platform; let's see how they translate to wireless Web 
services development. 
<P><STRONG>Advanced language features and standardization process 
</STRONG><BR>Java's modular nature allows it to expand and develop solutions for 
new computational problems. It has evolved from a popular client applet 
language, to a cross platform GUI builder, to an application server platform. 
This same modular nature now allows Java to drive wireless and Web services 
applications. 
<P>Java also offers a democratic standardization process. To attack specific 
problems, individual vendors often initially develop Java libraries, which can 
result in inconsistent APIs for similar functionalities. To keep Java 
applications interoperable and Java code portable in the future, we must 
consolidate and standardize APIs. The JCP (Java Community Process) ensures that 
all interested parties voice their concerns and that no standard API unfairly 
benefits any one vendor. Standardization proves especially important for 
wireless Web services, due to the large number of vendors and providers 
involved. Many organizations have already started developing major JSRs (Java 
Specification Requests) that will standardize important new tools and APIs for 
wireless and Web service Java applications. We will mention those ongoing 
efforts later in this article. 
<P><STRONG>Cross-platform compatibility </STRONG><BR>Windows-dominated desktop 
computers might not leverage Java's Write Once, Run Anywhere compatibility, but 
Java's platform-independence could benefit both wireless frontend applications 
and Web services backend applications.
<P>Multiple hardware and OS platforms have and will continue to share the 
wireless information devices market for the following reasons:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Due to their personal and pervasive nature, wireless devices are perceived 
  as consumer electronics. Consumers do not care what is under a device's hood 
  as long it does the specific job, thus allowing multiple vendors to co-exist 
  in the same product category. Each vendor can achieve similar functionalities 
  using different approaches. For example, different vendors manufacture dozens 
  of cell phones on different platforms that all provide largely the same 
  functionalities.
  <P></P>
  <LI>Unlike desktop computers, which are designed for generic computing tasks, 
  wireless devices usually complete specific tasks with minimum sizes and 
  optimal user interfaces. Thus, the huge variety of mobile applications 
  requires many different devices and innovative solutions from many different 
  vendors. No single vendor can provide the best solution for all tasks. For 
  example, among PDA vendors are a variety of CPU and OS platforms. Palm OS, the 
  most popular PDA platform, targets small, cheap, easy-to-use devices with 
  basic features. Windows CE and embedded Linux devices are quickly gaining 
  market share on high-end devices. </LI></UL>
<P>The heavy competition in the wireless devices market benefits customers by 
offering choices. But the fragmented platforms create a nightmare for 
developers. Repeatedly developing and maintaining different versions of the same 
application for different devices is prohibitively expensive. Yet, any 
general-purpose wireless application must run on all types of devices customers 
might own. Thus, cross-platform compatibility is a core issue to consider when 
developing wireless applications.
<P>The server back end features many platforms ranging from Linux, to Unix, to 
Windows. J2EE's (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) success has proved the 
value of cross-platform compatibility on the server side. As the back end 
evolves into multivendor, multiplatform, and interoperable Web services 
networks, Java's value will increase. 
<P>Though a core advantage of Java, cross-platform compatibility comes at a 
price: a performance price. No absolute compatibility exists among a huge 
variety of wireless devices. For example, you can't possibly port the full 
features of an application designed to run on a TV set-top box to a tiny cell 
phone. Even among similar devices, such as high- and low-end cell phones, 
portability can cause under-utilization of resources on one device, while 
straining the resources of another. The J2ME platform balances Java's 
portability with performance on many wireless platforms. As we discussed, Sun 
divided J2ME into multiple configurations and profiles to achieve maximum 
functionality and performance for different device categories, and ensure 
portability within any one category. 
<P><STRONG>Security </STRONG><BR>In addition to providing a compatibility layer, 
the JVM also provides application security through the following ways:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The JVM verifies the byte-code application at class load time to ensure 
  that the application does not do anything dangerous 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The JVM monitors the application execution and avoids memory leaks
  <P></P>
  <LI>The JVM can incorporate a security manager or sandbox to verify 
  application digital signatures and grant permissions to access specific APIs 
  (domains) based on the signer's trust level</LI></UL>
<P>The three security features above prove important to wireless applications. 
Wireless devices usually store personal and sensitive data. Users often download 
mobile code from an insecure Internet. We must ensure that the downloaded 
application is not a virus and will not try to corrupt or even steal data from 
the device. To combat such attacks, the J2SE and J2ME/CDC platforms offer fully 
featured, secure JVMs. J2ME/MIDP uses a simplified byte-code verification scheme 
to minimize performance hits. Domain-based security managers are available for 
MIDP 2.0 VMs. 
<P>In addition to application security, Java provides excellent support for 
industry-strength authentication, authorization, and cryptography-based 
communication security protocols. The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) and Java 
Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) frameworks are both pluggable 
and flexible. They provide a set of abstract interfaces of common security 
algorithms and concepts to application developers. Different providers supply 
the implementations. You can easily add new algorithms into the frameworks. 
Java's security framework design separates applications from security solution 
providers. Therefore, it allows you to choose or switch to any provider and 
algorithm at any stage of software development without learning new APIs or 
worrying about compatibility issues. We will discuss more about Java application 
security technologies in the following section. <!-- break -->
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Core technologies </STRONG></FONT><BR>We now discuss 
the core Java technologies needed to support wireless Web services. Some are 
already available in standard Java APIs; some are currently offered by 
third-party vendors and are being standardized; others are only in the planning 
and designing stages. 
<P><STRONG>Interoperable XML standards </STRONG><BR>As we mentioned earlier, Web 
services are built around standard XML communication protocols. In wireless Web 
services applications, servers and clients are loosely coupled with XML 
messages. So both Web services application servers and wireless devices must 
support standard XML protocols.
<P>On the server side, the J2SE/J2EE platform offers excellent support for 
generic and Web services-specific XML processing through the Java API for XML 
Parsing (JAXP). JAXP features the following:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Both pull and push mode SAX (Simple API for XML) parsing 
  <LI>Standard DOM (Document Object Model) and a more Java-friendly JDOM format 
  <LI>Java API for XML Binding (JAXB), which supports persistent XML mapping for 
  Java objects 
  <LI>Java API for XML Messaging (JAXM) and JAX-RPC, which can support Web 
  services SOAP and XML-RPC messages 
  <LI>Java API for XML Registries (JAXR), which supports XML registries such as 
  UDDI and ebXML</LI></UL>
<P>On the wireless front, mainly three concerns crop up when using XML on small 
devices:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>CLDC VMs have limited string functionalities and cannot run generic XML 
  parsers written for J2SE or any Web services XML APIs built on top of them
  <P></P>
  <LI>Support for XML requires increased processing power
  <P></P>
  <LI>XML formats embed data in verbose text tags, which does not conserve 
  limited wireless bandwidth</LI></OL>
<P>Third-party groups offer many CLDC-based XML parsers that require little 
processing power. Most, such as NanoXML and TinyXML, only support the simpler 
serial SAX-style parsing. However, in-memory objects are required if you want to 
manipulate complex XML data. Package kXML developed by Enhydra.org offers both 
SAX- and DOM-style parsers. A W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)-compliant DOM 
parser proves too heavy for small devices, so kXML uses a lightweight 
alternative called kDOM. In addition to generic XML parsers, kXML also has 
packages specialized for SOAP (kSOAP) and XML-RPC (kXML-RPC) message processing. 
With JSR 172, the J2ME Web Services Specification, the JCP continues its effort 
to standardize XML support on the J2ME platform. 
<P>XML's excessive bandwidth usage has long proved problematic in wireless 
application development. WAP developers use an XML compression protocol called 
WBXML (WAP binary XML) to compress WML communication data. You can adopt WBXML 
as a standard format for compressing generic XML documents. You must install 
matching compressor and expander modules on both wireless and server sides. kXML 
provides both modules. 
<P><STRONG>Wireless user interfaces </STRONG><BR>The major advantage of wireless 
information devices is their pervasiveness; they melt into our everyday lives. 
This ability requires not only small, wearable devices, but also devices with 
nonintrusive user interfaces. The success of Palm PDAs has proven the 
effectiveness of touch-screen and handwriting recognition input methods. 
Migrating mature desktop GUIs to small devices has also proven successful since 
today's computer literate public needs little training to use common GUI 
components such as buttons, selection boxes, and textboxes. Most J2ME 
technologies support GUIs. The smallest MIDP has its own lightweight GUI 
components and event-handling models. More complex profiles, such as the PDA 
profile and Personal Profile, adopt GUI models commonly used in the desktop J2SE 
world (such as AWT) to ensure the maximum portability level.
<P>Though convenient, GUI-based devices are still interruptive. For example, on 
a GUI-based device, users have to use both hands to input long text or make 
complex selections. By contrast, voice-navigated information services can 
integrate into workflows much better. We can talk on the phone while performing 
other sophisticated tasks (such as driving). The leading technology enabling 
voice-based information navigation is VoiceXML. Similar to HTML, a VoiceXML page 
can present information, take user input, and jump to another page based on that 
input. The difference: An HTML page presents and takes <EM>text</EM> 
information, while a VoiceXML page handles <EM>voice</EM> information. However, 
VoiceXML pages are written in XML text format since backend applications that 
generate VoiceXML pages only work with text data. Voice recognition and 
synthesis technology proves crucial to bridging voice and XML text formats.
<P>JSR 113, the Java Speech API 2.0, proposes a set of standard Java APIs for 
voice recognition and synthesis. But voice algorithms still prove too 
computationally intensive for small handheld devices and require expensive 
software. Current VoiceXML applications require gateway servers to perform voice 
recognition and synthesis. Those voice gateway servers could become parts of 
voice portals, similar to WAP portals. The voice portals act as information call 
centers for customers: they contact Web services on behalf of users and 
translate information back and forth among voice, text, VoiceXML, and SOAP 
messages. However, with the exclusive voice portal model, the mobile application 
can only access the portal through a voice phone line/channel, and all 
information must be presented in voice format.
<P>For many applications, we want to mix voice information with other forms of 
digital information, such as graphics, text messaging, and streaming video. One 
way to integrate voice into TCP/IP network-based applications is through Voice 
over IP (VoIP). VoIP specifies how we should transport voice on a data network. 
VoIP-enabled VoiceXML gateways can respond to voice streams from the Internet 
instead of a phone line. A VoIP server can be just a hub service in the vast 
network of backend Web services. 
<P>Figure 3 illustrates the architecture of a smart wireless application that 
uses both voice and common GUIs.

<P><STRONG>Security </STRONG><BR>As discussed previously, Java supports 
cryptography and mobile code security. However, securing Web services proves 
more challenging than securing traditional Internet applications. Web services 
are designed to improve productivity and interoperability; security comes as an 
afterthought and is largely vendor-specific. Yet, Web services run outside 
corporate firewalls and can potentially expose an internal network to the 
outside world. As a result, security concerns provide major obstacles in 
deploying Web services. Security is also a chief challenge for wireless 
applications due to radio signals' vulnerability to interception and the lack of 
computing power for performing strong cryptography operations on small devices. 
In this section, we discuss Java technologies on both server and wireless ends 
that improve wireless Web services security.
<P>Web services require end-to-end security for XML messages traveling across 
multiple intermediaries, thereby making traditional point-to-point secure 
communication channels (such as HTTPS) inadequate. Secure XML protocols such as 
XML Digital Signature and XML Encryption can bind with Web services 
communication protocols (such as SOAP) to secure XML contents. JSRs 105 and 
106—the XML Digital Signature APIs and XML Digital Encryption APIs, 
respectively—propose Java APIs to support XML Digital Signature and XML 
Encryption. However, on the wireless front, most standard Java security and 
cryptography APIs are only available to J2SE and J2ME/CDC applications. Due to 
small devices' limited computing power, J2ME/MIDP only officially support HTTPS 
secure connections from the upcoming MIDP specification version 2.0. Only 
third-party vendors provide support for general cryptography algorithms on the 
J2ME/MIDP platform. One such lightweight CLDC-compatible cryptography package is 
the Bouncy Castle Crypto APIs. To learn how to use these APIs, please refer to 
Michael Yuan's <EM>developerWorks</EM> article, "<A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-06-2002/jw-0621-wireless_p.html#resources">Securing 
Your J2ME/MIDP Apps</A>," (June 2002).
<P>Another vitally important security feature in Web services is <EM>single 
sign-on</EM>, required for keeping multiple service vendors transparent to 
users. Sun's Liberty Alliance Project promotes single sign-on services based on 
federated identity. The alliance will probably base the implementation on 
Kerberos technology. You can deploy Kerberos plug-ins for JAAS for tight 
integration among Web services. You can also embed Kerberos-like security tokens 
in SOAP message headers as SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) elements 
for loosely coupled solutions. JSR 155, the Web Services Security Assertions, 
proposes Java APIs that support SAML. IBM and Microsoft's WS-Security, another 
set of XML protocols, competes with SAML. The IBM Web Services Toolkit offers 
Java solutions for WS-Security.
<P>When approved, JSR 177, the Security and Trust Services API for J2ME, will 
provide Java APIs to SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards embedded in wireless 
devices. SIM cards usually store identity and cryptography keys. They provide 
automatic authentication and authorization on wireless phone networks. Together 
with SAML or WS-Security, JSR 177 APIs could enable automatic single sign-on 
services for SIM-enabled wireless devices. 
<P>For more discussion on J2ME and Web services security, please refer to our 
article "<A

Wireless J2ME</A>" (<EM>developerWorks,</EM> June 2002). 
<P><STRONG>Performance </STRONG><BR>One of the biggest problems with smart 
wireless applications is performance. As alluded to earlier, Java's development 
productivity and cross-platform compatibility take priority, and, thus, the JVM 
cannot benefit from many hardware-specific optimizations. However, advanced 
security and application data-processing features require high performance on 
the wireless end. Efforts such as JSR 177 are underway to make special hardware 
features available to standard Java APIs. Technologies such as Java-optimized 
CPUs and coprocessors, and just-in-time Java compilers are already available. 
For many applications, Java programs run as fast as C/C++ applications. Sun's 
project Monty promises to deliver CLDC and CDC VMs that run 10 times faster than 
current VMs with small footprints. 
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Go wireless </STRONG></FONT><BR>In this article, we 
introduced wireless Web services and the Java technologies that could power 
them. Current and emerging Java platforms are well positioned to help develop 
pervasive wireless solutions. Today's buzz phrase, <EM>wireless Web
