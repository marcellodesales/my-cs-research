All the undegrad and grad research projects compiled into a project. All the Computer Science projects developed 
during undergraduate, specialization and graduate programs.

* Masters Dissertation at San Francisco State University: https://github.com/marcellodesales/sfsu-cs-masters-thesis-netbeams

This project aims to archive all the Computer Science projects developed over the course of my life in the academic world, dedicated to studying 
Computer Science at different universities.

# B.S. in Computer Science

## UFAL, Alagoas, Brazil

I started my undergraduate in Computer Science at the Universidade Federal de Alagoas (UFAL), located in Maceio, 
Alagoas, Brazil. I spent 4 years in the program and I was awarded with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer 
Science from Feb-1999 to Mar-2003.

# M.S. in Computer Science

## UFCG, Paraiba, Brazil

Later, I spent 6 months as a "special" graduate student at the Universidade Federal de Campina Grande (UFCG), Paraiba, Brazil.
I took a Master of Science in Computer Science research position in Mar-2003, when I dropped in Aug-2003.

## UFPE, Pernambuco, Brazil

### Specialization in Mobile Software Test Engineering, Motorola, CIN-UFPE

Taking a decision to start over, I was accepted as an Intern position at Motorola Brazil Test Center in a joint program 
with the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE) for a `specialization` program in Mobile Software Test Engineering 
in Jan-2004. I concluded the program and was awarded of Specialist in Mobile Software Testing in Nov-2004.

### Researcher, Motorola at CIN-UFPE

Motorola offered a researcher position as Software Test Automation Researcher while I focused on my Masters of Science in Computer 
Science research that I had been awarded. I dropped out of the program in Jun 2005 to moved to the the US.

## Infoserve Technologies Institute, NY, USA

### Java Associate Programming Certificate

When I moved to the US, I had chosen to live in the Three-State area of New York City in Jun 2005. I moved to New Jersey 
and started a computing school at the Infoserve Technologies Institute in Manhattan, NYC. I concluded the `Java Associate 
Programming Certificate`, as well as doing open-source research and contributions until Dec 2006.

## SFSU, California, USA

Finishing school, I moved to South San Francisco, California. My dream tech place! I started working and research was 
not a priority until one year later when I joined the Master of Science in Computer Science program at San Francisco 
State University in Feb 2008. I worked in a vast variety of projects during 2 years in that program, including 
NetBeams and the initial development of CollabNet Subversion Edge during an internship. I was awarded the degree of 
Master of Science in Computer Science in December 2009 after defending the work of `A Key-Value-based Persistence Model for Sensor 
Networks`. 

This is going to be maintained as a repository of contributions to what I had done, as well as for references to other 
students.
