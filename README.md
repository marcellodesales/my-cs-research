==============

All the undegrad and grad research projects compiled into a project. All the Computer Science projects developed 
during undergraduate, specialization and graduate programs.

Context
============

This project aims to archive computer science projects developed over the course of 12 years dedicated to studying 
Computer Science at different universities and internship projects.

I started my undergraduate in Computer Science at the Universidade Federal de Alagoas (UFAL), located in Maceio, 
Alagoas, Brazil. I spent 4 years in the program and I was awarded with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer 
Science from Feb-1999 to Mar-2003.

Later, I spent 6 months as a "special" graduate student at the Universidade Federal de Campina Grande (UFCG), Paraiba. 
I took a Master of Science in Computer Science research position in Mar-2003, when I dropped in Aug-2003.

Taking a decision to start over, I was accepted as an Intern position at Motorola Brazil Test Center in a joint program 
with the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE) for a "specialization" program in Mobile Software Test Engineering 
in Jan-2004. I concluded the program and was awarded of Specialist in Mobile Software Testing in Nov-2004. Then, Motorola 
offered a researcher position as Software Test Automation Researcher while I would focus my Masters of Science in Computer 
Science research. I dropped to the program in Jun-2005, when I moved to the US.

When I moved to the US, I had chosen to live in the Three-State area of New York City in Jun-2005. I moved to New Jersey 
and started a computing school at the Infoserve Technologies Institute in Manhattan. I concluded the Java Associate 
Programming Certificate, as well as doing open-source research and contributions until Dec-2006.

Finishing school, I moved to South San Francisco, in California. My dream tech place! I started working and research was 
not a priority until one year later when I joined the Master of Science in Computer Science program at San Francisco 
State University in Feb-2008. I worked in a vast variety of projects during the 2 years of the program, including 
NetBeams and the initial development of CollabNet Subversion Edge during an internship. I was awarded the degree of 
Master of Science in Computer Science in December 2009 after defending A Key-Value-based Persistence Model for Sensor 
Networks. Project is located at http://research.marcellodesales.info/sfsu/netbeams/docs/ms-cs-degree-thesis.pdf

This is going to be maintained as a repository of contributions to what I had done, as well as for references to other 
students.
